Arch example to help efficiently create system arch diagrams.
Uses mermaid js in a simple HTML wrapper to allow for remote icon loading.
Note the example with AWS icons - does your client use these?
Hope it helps.

How to:
- Load any icons sets from npm using unpkg site (ask gpt for version help if you need)
- Name them like I have done e.g. logos
- Edit the mermaid markdown within the html `<pre> tag`
- Call the icon like logos:gunicorn
- Read docs for direction instructions, its intuitive.
